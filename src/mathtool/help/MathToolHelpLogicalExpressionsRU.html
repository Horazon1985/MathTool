MathTool can also understand and evaluate logical expressions. 
The operators !, &, |, > and = correspond to the logical operators NEGATION, AND, OR, IMPLICATION and EQUIVALENCE.<br>
<i>Important:</i> Disregarding the fact that the AND and OR operators, respectively, are often denoted by * and +, respectively, MathTool does not accept this. 
This serves to prevent misunderstandings when compiling. Otherwise, MathTool would not know, if<br><br>

a + 1<br><br>

is an arithmetic or a logical expression. Valid logical expressions look like<br><br>

a&!b, !(a&b|c)>1|d, ...<br><br>

MathTool returns a logical expression immediately in a simplified form, if possible. However, this may lead to increased waiting times, if the expression is too complicated and the simplification takes far too long. 
Variables can be denoted by a small letter or by a small letter with an index. In contrast to variables in arithmetic expressions, apostrophes are not allowed. 
Note, that MathTool removes empty space as well as makes capital letters to small letters while compiling a logical expression. Hence, the variable A_3 will be the same variable as a_3.
